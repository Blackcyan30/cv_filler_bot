# Deployment Plan
## Frontend
- Host React dashboard on AWS S3.
- Use AWS CloudFront for global distribution.
## Backend
- Deploy FastAPI services on AWS Lambda with API Gateway.
## Machine Learning
- Train TensorFlow model on AWS SageMaker.
- Deploy model as a SageMaker endpoint for real-time predictions.
## Browser Automation
- Run Playwright scripts on an AWS EC2 instance.
## Frontend Deployment

1. **React Dashboard**:

   - Build the React app:

 ```bash
 npm run build
 ```

   - Deploy to AWS S3:

 ```bash
 aws s3 sync build/ s3://<your-bucket-name>
 ```

   - Configure CloudFront for distribution.
   
## Backend Deployment

1. **FastAPI Backend**:
   - Package the backend:

 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 zip -r backend.zip.
 ```

   - Deploy to AWS Lambda using the Serverless Framework or AWS CLI.

2. **Playwright Automation**:

   - Launch an EC2 instance with Node.js installed.

   - Install Playwright dependencies:

 ```bash
 npm install playwright
 ```

   - Configure the instance to trigger automation scripts.

## Machine Learning Deployment

1. **TensorFlow Model**:

   - Train the model locally or on SageMaker.

   - Deploy to a SageMaker endpoint for real-time inference.
  
2. **Integration**:

   - Ensure the backend queries the SageMaker endpoint for predictions.

## Monitoring

- Use **AWS CloudWatch** for logging backend and automation scripts.

- Monitor SageMaker endpoints for model performance metrics.
